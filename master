/*The program asks for how many jackalopes are in the population. Then it asks for how many generations you want the program to measure. It will increase each generation by 3% born and decrease 1%. 

Sample output
How many jackalopes do you have? 132
How many generations do you want to wait? 2
If you start with 132 jackalopes and wait 2 generations 
you'll end up with 137 jackalopes
Do you want to continue? 
(y/n) y
How many jackalopes do you have? 500
How many generations do you want to wait? 5
If you start with 500 jackalopes and wait 5 generations 
you'll end up with 551 jackalopes
Do you want to continue? 
(y/n) y
How many jackalopes do you have? 500
How many generations do you want to wait? 5
If you start with 500 jackalopes and wait 5 generations 
you'll end up with 551 jackalopes
Do you want to continue?
